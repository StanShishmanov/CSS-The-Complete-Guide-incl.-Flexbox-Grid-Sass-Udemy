Amazon has something called BSR " Best seller Rank" any category you select will have a list of the top 100 -


The dream would be to be able to see the top 2000 in a category based on there BSR rank- and filter out negative keywords like - Marvel, Disney, Nike, Adidas to set a price range from say £7 to £18 this will start to leave only those products which are possible market trends for niche designs. Which we can then concentrate our designs around.


There is a google plugin called prettymerch - https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/prettymerch-for-merch-by/ahclfnpmodphlaiidnpjlkndabpnihea

PrettyMerch for Merch by Amazon™
A beautiful dashboard for Merch by Amazon. It updates as you sell and notifies you instantly about new sales with a cha-ching sound
chrome.google.com

It kind of does this already but is designed for users of the Merch by Amazon who just create designs rather than my company that actually prints and ships- would be great to also extend the functionality to ebay and etsy-

If I was getting daily updates on new entries, changes in what is popular and can get them to market fast enough that will be a powerful tool. I believe Amazon changed something in the past few days that blocks bots from traditional web scraping, they will not want a tool like this to work and so will have to operate stealthily in the background.
