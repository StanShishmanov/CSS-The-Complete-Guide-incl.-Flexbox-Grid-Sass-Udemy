Hi Adam, here as an inspection report I made for your project.

INSPECTION REPORT

Inspection of sportsinteraction.com

- is using Geo Location protection
- is using CloudFlare protection
- is JavaScript heavy i.e. requires Selenium browser (Chrome works)
- IP Address tracking
- may have more anti-bot measures implemented which are not visible during initial inspection

Required data can be reached via selenium therefore it CAN be scraped.
Estimated time to build a flawless scraper with selenium - undetermined - too many unknowns regarding all anti-bot measures as well as general website behavior with javascript - may result in multitude of unexpected errors when using selenium which will extend building time.


Inspection of pro-football-reference.com, fbref.com, sports-reference.com, basketball-reference.com, hockey-reference.com, baseball-reference.com

- data is easier to reach as it is presented via html
- no JavaScript detected
- although similar in visible structure, the way the data is presented varies between the different domains

Required data can be extracted via scrapy
Each website will require its own scraper to be built and run

Estimated time per scraper to be built - 1-2 days

Creation of MySQL database, to be hosted on your server - a couple of days

EXTRA INFORMATION:
- sportsinteraction.com does not require browser incognito mode in order for the data to be reached.
- sportsinteraction.com does not require Chrome browser in particular in order for the data to be reached (Firefox works as well)
- sportsinteraction.com does not require the latest version of Chrome to be installed on a machine in order to present the necessary data, much older versions of Chrome work as well.

PROXY IP ADDRESS
Regarding the purchase of a proxy IP Address - once the scrapers are deployed and start running on your server, they will automatically use the server's IP address. If, at some point, that IP address gets banned/ blocked by a website, what normally is done is making a modification to the code to start utilizing some of the many proxy IP services. This, being a service, allows you to use a different proxy address only when you request it i.e. when you send a request towards sportsinteraction.com, the request first goes through the IP service provider and from there it makes a request towards sportsinteraction.com itself. Then, after the necessary data is extracted, it is returned towards the scraper for future data manipulation/ transportation.
These services are relatively cheap and usually charge a set price for either "per thousands of requests package" or "per each request".
If this type of services is needed, I will introduce you to some of the best of them for you to pick one.

QUESTIONS:
- How often will you need each of the scrapers to run - minutes, hours, days, weeks? Different times for different scrapers?
- When you write that you 'scrape' data from these websites - are you doing this manually or you already have scripts for that?

OVERVIEW

Overall, I can do all of the scrapers you want with the data you need. 
Some will take a few days and for sportsinteraction.com - I do not know how long it will take for certain as this will be revealed as I start working on it.
As for the database - it can be done as well.

As for the type of payment - I generally prefer working on per hour basis.

Let me know if you have any questions and we can move forward from there.

Thanks,
Stan
